# icynfo

**icynfo** can show information about an Icecast server that you manage. On starting it adds an icon to the system tray, and when you hover over it, information about your currently running sources and the number of listeners will appear.

The tray icon also has a menu that allows you to add and delete servers as well as quit the application altogether.

# Notes

**icynfo** was developed and only tested on OS X Sierra on Java 8. Anything else and youâ€™re own your own.
